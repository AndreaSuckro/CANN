# CANN
Framework overview for the Concepts and Applications of Neural Networks (CANN) course at the Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabr√ºck in the summer term 2016. In this repository we collected examples and installation instructions for three neural network frameworks: Theano, TensorFlow and Keras.

### data
Contains the mnist dataset for handwritten digit recognition. Feel free to use the data to play around. The original data is hosted on [Yann LeCun's site](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

### keras
Contains introduction and further sample implementations for the keras framework.

### playground
Contains implementation of keras, tensorflow and theano for the datasets presented on the [TensorFlow Playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org/).

### tensorflow
