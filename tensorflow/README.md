# TensorFlow

Welcome to the TensorFlow part of this small project! Before we start with the installation there are a couple of things to note:

  * TensorFlow does not support the Windows operating system at this point.
  * All code in this repository is written for Python >3.5. If you use a different Python version checkout the [official installation instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/os_setup.html#pip_installation).
  * If you do not have Python installed on your system yet, check your favorite package manager for `python` and `jupyter`.
